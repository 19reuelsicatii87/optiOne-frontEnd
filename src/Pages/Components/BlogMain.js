                                    of their illnesses and those who were not, it was determined

                                <p className="card-text">Psoriasis typically affects the outside of the elbows, knees or scalp,
                                    though it can appear on any location. Some people report that psoriasis
                                    is itchy, burns and stings. Psoriasis is associated with other serious
                                    health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and depression.
                                    While scientists do not know what exactly causes psoriasis,
                                    we do know that the immune system and genetics play major roles
                                    in its development. Usually, something triggers psoriasis to flare. </p>
