                        <p className="text-start">However, there are also other people who have claimed that it didn't have any effect on them.
                            Upon gathering information and interviewing some people, both from those who have been cured
                            of their illnesses and those who were not, it was determined that those who achieved great
                            results followed the correct measure or amount of consumption depending on their type of
                            disease compared to those who claim they did not benefit at all.</p>

                            the management has not made any such claims ever before. In fact, in spite of hundreds of
                            testimonies, One Opti still asserts no approved therapeutic claims and that the reported
                            results are only based on true testimonies from individuals who experienced and reported
                            the effects of the product to their own health upon presentation of their own medical
                            examination results before and after drinking One Opti Juice, these proofs were voluntarily
                            provided and presented by consumers publicly and not from any manners of solicitation.</p>

                        <p className="text-start">A bottle of One Opti Juice contains 30 grams of powdered extracts from its
                            15 herbal ingredients. This powder is highly concentrated so you have to make sure that it is dissolved
                            properly which will allow maximized infusion of all its minerals with the water on a molecular level.
                            <ul className="mt-3">
                                <li>STEP 1 - Fill the bottle with distilled water until half full.</li>
                                <li>STEP 2 - Shake well in a circular motion to avoid creating air bubbles that lessen the consistency of water.</li>
                                <li>STEP 3 - When the powder is completely dissolved, fill again with distilled water up to the bottle's neck.</li>
                                <li>STEP 4 - Shake gently by tilting the bottle left and right repeatedly. Again, avoid making air bubbles.</li>
                                <li>STEP 5 - Leave the bottle in a cool place or at room temperature and let it sit for a good 10 to 15
                                    minutes before consuming. This will allow the minerals to infuse and bind effectively with the water.
                                    In case you haven't noticed, this is the reason why One Opti Juice tastes more delicious when left for a while.</li>

                        <p className="text-start">If your patient is suffering from a serious illness like diabetes,
                            cancer, hepatitis, tuberculosis, leukemia, and other dreadful diseases, this means their
                            immune system is under severe attack and their cells are degenerating. In order to fight
                            these diseases effectively, it is also needed that you induce them with a high level of
                            antibodies and nutrients from One Opti Juice. Here are the suggested amount of intake for
                            these kinds of conditions.
                            <br></br>
                            <br></br>
                            <b>1 Bottle per day</b>
                            <ul className="mt-1">
                                <li>It is not recommended to drink 1 bottle at once. Like any other food that you take
                                    excessively, your body will not consume all of it and those excesses will only be
                                    excreted from the body as wastes. This means, you are wasting the full potential
                                    of the product and not all minerals or nutrients will be used by your own body.</li>
                                <li>The best recommendation is to dink One Opti Juice, 2 to 3 times a day, partitioning
                                    the content of one bottle into two or three parts. For example, half a bottle in the
                                    morning and half a bottle in the evening at least 30 minutes before each meal.</li>
                                <li>The best-recommended intake is 3 times a day using a jigger, take 2 jiggers at
                                    least 30 minutes before meal as illustrated below. This ensures your body is
                                    consuming all nutrients and minerals from one bottle, therefore, benefiting
                                    from its full potential.</li>
                                <li>Follow these recommendations on schedule until the condition is regulated or
                                    until the next medical examination shows improvement then you can reduce the
                                    intake gradually as detailed in the next recommendations below.</li>

                            </ul>

                        <h3 className="text-start text-primary">Common Illnesses</h3>
                        <p className="text-start">To help with fast recovery if the patient has a fever, cold, ordinary cough,
                            hyperacidity, headache, or any type of common sickness, the best recommendation is at least 1 full
                            jigger twice a day. This will allow a sufficient supply of nutrients that your body needs while recovering,
                            enough to detoxify, kill viruses and bacteria, and flush out free radicals and toxins that cause diseases.</p>

                        <p className="text-start">Lastly, if you are currently healthy and without sickness, you can
                            always be sure to safeguard your health by maintaining a strong immune system. Half a jigger of
                            One Opti Juice once or twice a day provides more than enough amount of antioxidants that
                            strengthen your immune defense and maintain healthy cells and body.</p>
                        <h3 className="text-start text-primary">Kids and Infants</h3>
                        <p className="text-start">One Opti Juice is safe for kids and babies. This product is consists
                            of all-natural herbal ingredients and does not include any chemical compounds that may be harmful
                            to children. Similar to what is mentioned above, intake depends on health conditions only lesser
                            than the recommended consumption for adults.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">Fact is, one bottle of One Opti Juice contains 648,000 units of ORAC Value, which means half a
                            jigger contains 92,571 units. ORAC Value determines the level of antioxidants present in food
                            that protect us from sickness. A human body only requires 3,000-5,000 units to have just the
                            right amount of protection. Imagine, half a jigger of One Opti Juice contains 95,571 units,
                            which is 20 times stronger than what the human body needs daily.</p>
