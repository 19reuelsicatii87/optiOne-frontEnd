                        <p className="text-start">Psoriasis typically affects the outside of the elbows, knees or
                            scalp, though it can appear on any location. Some people report that psoriasis is itchy,
                            burns and stings. Psoriasis is associated with other serious health conditions, such as
                            diabetes, heart disease and depression.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">While scientists do not know what exactly causes psoriasis,
                            we do know that the immune system and genetics play major roles in its development.
                            Usually, something triggers psoriasis to flare. The skin cells in people with psoriasis
                            grow at an abnormally fast rate, which causes the buildup of psoriasis lesions.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of the disease
                            and appears as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells.
                            These patches or plaques most often show up on the scalp, knees, elbows and lower back.
                            They are often itchy and painful, and they can crack and bleed.</p>
