                        <p className="text-start">Parotid tumors are the most common type of salivary gland tumors,
                            accounting for 80 to 85 percent of all salivary gland tumors. While most parotid tumors are
                            noncancerous (benign), the parotid glands are where nearly 25 percent of cancerous (malignant)
                            salivary gland tumors develop.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">The parotid glands, located just in front of the ears on each side
                            of the face, are the largest of the three sets of major salivary glands. They are responsible
                            for producing saliva to aid in chewing and digesting food.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">Parotid tumors may present a variety of characteristics. If you have
                            a parotid tumor, you may notice a mass or swelling in your jaw area that may or may not be painful.
                            If the tumor is malignant, it may also affect facial nerves, causing pain, numbness, a burning
                            or prickling sensation, or loss of movement in the face.</p>

                        <p className="text-start">Vivian is an OFW in Dubai. She suffers from Parotid Gland Cancer and
                            decided to come home to the Philippines to get medical treatment.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">Vivian had undergone several tests getting several medical opinions
                            but the result always turns out positive. She was then recommended to undergo operation,
                            radiotheraphy and/or chemotheraphy, in hopes that it would help getting cured from her illness.</p>
                        <p className="text-start">She didn't lose hope and was keen to find anything the will heal her
                            disease. Until someone introduced One Opti Juice to her. Without second thoughts, she started
                            taking One Opti Juice every single day. After three months, she went to have another set of
                            laboratory tests and CT Scan. She was filled with joy when the result came out, the tumors were
                            gone and the biopsy turned out negative.She didn't need aggressive treatments anymore. She was cleared,
                            given fit to work, and now back in Dubai living a normal life.</p>
